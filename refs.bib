@COMMENT{

This file contains a bibliography of malaria vector biology and
genomics.

If adding new entries, please observe the following conventions:

  1. Use author surname + year for the entry identifier, capitalising
     the surname, e.g., "Smith2009". If duplicate identifiers exist,
     suffix with a lower case letter, e.g., "Smith2009a",
     "Smith2009b", etc.

  2. Insert new entries in alphabetical order by entry identifier.

  3. It is suggested to remove abstract fields to keep the file more compact.
